These instructions were developed for Windows 7 and recently updated for Windows 10.

The software packages for the installation are in: [Lego Package.zip](Setup/Lego Package.zip).
Open the Lego Packages zip file and follow the instructions in the [LegoNXTInstall.pdf](Setup/LegoNXTInstall.pdf) doc.

For installation on Linux or MacOSX follow the instructions on the Lejos site: http://lejos-osek.sourceforge.net/index.htm under the installation link.
Your experience may vary slightly from that described in the above instructions. This is typical for real-world embedded development.
